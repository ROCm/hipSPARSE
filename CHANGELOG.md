# Changelog for hipSPARSE

Documentation for hipSPARSE is available at
[https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/hipSPARSE/en/latest/](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/hipSPARSE/en/latest/).

## (Unreleased) hipSPARSE 3.2.0

### Added

* Added `azurelinux` OS name for correcting gfortran dependency

## hipSPARSE 3.1.2 for ROCm 6.3.0

### Added

* Added an alpha version of the hipsparse-bench executable to facilitate comparing NVIDIA CUDA cuSPARSE and rocSPARSE backends

### Changed

* Changed the default compiler from hipcc to amdclang in the install script and cmake files.

### Optimized

* Improved the user documentation

### Known issues

* In `hipsparseSpSM_solve()`, the external buffer is passed as a parameter. This does not match the NVIDIA CUDA cuSPARSE API. This extra external buffer parameter will be removed in a future release. For now this extra parameter can be ignored and nullptr passed as it is unused internally by `hipsparseSpSM_solve()`.

## hipSPARSE 3.1.1 for ROCm 6.2.0

### Additions

* Added missing `hipsparseCscGet()` routine

### Changes

* All internal hipSPARSE functions now exist inside a namespace
* Match deprecations found in NVIDIA CUDA cuSPARSE 12.x.x when using NVIDIA CUDA cuSPARSE backend.

### Fixes

* Fixed SpGEMM and SpGEMM_reuse routines which were not matching NVIDIA CUDA cuSPARSE behaviour

### Optimizations

* Improved user manual 
* Improved contribution guidelines

### Known issues

* In `hipsparseSpSM_solve()`, we currently pass the external buffer as a parameter. This does not match the NVIDIA CUDA cuSPARSE API and this extra external buffer parameter will be removed in a future release. For now this extra parameter can be ignored and nullptr passed as it is unused internally by `hipsparseSpSM_solve()`.

## hipSPARSE 3.0.1 for ROCm 6.1.0

### Fixes

* Fixed an issue where the `rocm` folder was not removed after upgrading meta packages
* Fixed a compilation issue with the NVIDIA CUDA cuSPARSE backend
* Added more detailed messages for unit test failures due related to missing input data
* Improved documentation
* Fixed a bug with deprecation messages when using gcc9

    NVIDIA CUDA cuSPARSE

## hipSPARSE 2.3.1 for ROCm 5.3.0

### Additions

## hipSPARSE 2.2.0 for ROCm 5.2.0

### Additions

* New packages for test and benchmark executables on all supported operating systems using CPack

## hipSPARSE 2.0.0 for ROCm 5.0.0

### Additions

* Added (conjugate) transpose support for `csrmv`, `hybmv`, and `spmv` routines

## hipSPARSE 1.11.2 for ROCm 4.5.0

### Additions

* Triangular solve for multiple right-hand sides using BSR format
* SpMV for BSRX format
* Enhanced SpMM in CSR format to work with transposed A
* Matrix coloring for CSR matrices
* Batched tridiagonal solve (`gtsv_strided_batch`)
* SpMM for BLOCKED ELL format
* Generic routines for SpSV and SpSM

* Additional atomic-based algorithms for SpMM in COO format
* Additional algorithm for SpMM in CSR format

### Changes

* Packaging has been split into a runtime package (`hipsparse`) and a development package
  (`hipsparse-devel`):
  The development package depends on the runtime package. When installing the runtime package,
  the package manager will suggest the installation of the development package to aid users
  transitioning from the previous version's combined package. This suggestion by package manager is
  for all supported operating systems (except CentOS 7) to aid in the transition. The `suggestion`
  feature in the runtime package is introduced as a deprecated feature and will be removed in a future
  ROCm release.

* GTest dependency has been updated to v1.10.0

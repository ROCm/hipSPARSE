hipSPARSE exposes a common interface that provides Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines for sparse computation implemented on top of AMD's Radeon Open Compute ROCm runtime and toolchains.
hipSPARSE is created using the HIP programming language and optimized for AMD's latest discrete GPUs.

In the following, three separate chapters are available:

  * :ref:`user_manual`: This is the manual of hipSPARSE.
    It can be seen as a starting guide for new users but also a reference book for more experienced developers.
  * :ref:`API <api>`: This is a list of API functions provided by hipSPARSE.

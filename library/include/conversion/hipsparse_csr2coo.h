*  \brief Convert a sparse CSR matrix into a sparse COO matrix
*
*  \details
*  \p hipsparseXcsr2coo converts the CSR array containing the row offsets, that point
*  to the start of every row, into a COO array of row indices.
*
*  \note
*  It can also be used to convert a CSC array containing the column offsets into a COO
*  array of column indices.
*
*  \note
*  This function is non blocking and executed asynchronously with respect to the host.
*  It may return before the actual computation has finished.
